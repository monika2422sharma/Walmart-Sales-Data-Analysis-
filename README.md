# WWalmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-
The objective of this project is to analyze the Walmart sales dataset to identify the best-performing stores and products, track sales patterns across various products, and understand customer purchasing behavior. The goal is to gain insights that can enhance and optimize sales strategies. The dataset, sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, includes historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores across different regions, each comprising multiple departments. Additionally, the dataset incorporates holiday markdown events, which are known to influence sales, but predicting their specific impact on different departments presents a complex challenge.
